# Python - Classes and Objects

### Tasks
* 0. My first square
  * Write an empty class Square that defines a square:

* 1. Square with size
  * Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 0-square.py)

* 2. Size validation
  * Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 1-square.py)

* 3. Area of a square
  * Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 2-square.py)

* 4. Access and update private attribute
  * Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 3-square.py)

* 5. Printing a square
  * Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 4-square.py)

* 6. Coordinates of a square
  * Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 5-square.py)

* 7. Singly linked list
  * Write a class Node that defines a node of a singly linked list by:
    * Private instance attribute: data
    * Private instance attribute: next_node
    * Instantiation with data and next_node: def __init__(self, data, next_node=None):

* 8. Print Square instance
  * Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 6-square.py)
    * Private instance attribute: size
    * Private instance attribute: position
    * Instantiation with optional size and optional position: def __init__(self, size=0, position=(0, 0)):
    * Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area
    * Public instance method: def my_print(self): that prints in stdout the square with the character #
    * Printing a Square instance should have the same behavior as my_print()

* 9. Compare 2 squares
  * Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 4-square.py)
  
* 10. ByteCode -> Python #5
   * Write the Python class MagicClass that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode
